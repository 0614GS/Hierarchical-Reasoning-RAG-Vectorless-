Each subagent can have its own `interrupt_on` configuration that overrides the main agent's settings:

```python  theme={null}
agent = create_deep_agent(
    tools=[delete_file, read_file],
    interrupt_on={
        "delete_file": True,
        "read_file": False,
    },
    subagents=[{
        "name": "file-manager",
        "description": "Manages file operations",
        "system_prompt": "You are a file management assistant.",
        "tools": [delete_file, read_file],
        "interrupt_on": {
            # Override: require approval for reads in this subagent
            "delete_file": True,
            "read_file": True,  # Different from main agent!
        }
    }],
    checkpointer=checkpointer
)
```

When a subagent triggers an interrupt, the handling is the same – check for `__interrupt__` and resume with `Command`.
