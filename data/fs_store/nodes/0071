Use deep agents when you need agents that can:

* **Handle complex, multi-step tasks** that require planning and decomposition
* **Manage large amounts of context** through file system tools
* **Delegate work** to specialized subagents for context isolation
* **Persist memory** across conversations and threads

For simpler use cases, consider using LangChain's [`create_agent`](/oss/python/langchain/agents) or building a custom [LangGraph](/oss/python/langgraph/overview) workflow.
