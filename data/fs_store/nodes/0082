Your deep agent automatically:

1. **Planned its approach**: Used the built-in `write_todos` tool to break down the research task
2. **Conducted research**: Called the `internet_search` tool to gather information
3. **Managed context**: Used file system tools (`write_file`, `read_file`) to offload large search results
4. **Spawned subagents** (if needed): Delegated complex subtasks to specialized subagents
5. **Synthesized a report**: Compiled findings into a coherent response
