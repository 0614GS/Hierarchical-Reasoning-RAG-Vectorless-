```python  theme={null}
# By default we provide a StateBackend
agent = create_deep_agent()

# Under the hood, it looks like
from deepagents.backends import StateBackend

agent = create_deep_agent(
    backend=(lambda rt: StateBackend(rt))   # Note that the tools access State through the runtime.state
)
```

**How it works:**

* Stores files in LangGraph agent state for the current thread.
* Persists across multiple agent turns on the same thread via checkpoints.

**Best for:**

* A scratch pad for the agent to write intermediate results.
* Automatic eviction of large tool outputs which the agent can then read back in piece by piece.
