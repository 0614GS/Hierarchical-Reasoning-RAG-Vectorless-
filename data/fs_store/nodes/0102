**Problem**: Main agent tries to do work itself instead of delegating.

**Solutions**:

1. **Make descriptions more specific:**

   ```python  theme={null}
   # ✅ Good
   {"name": "research-specialist", "description": "Conducts in-depth research on specific topics using web search. Use when you need detailed information that requires multiple searches."}

   # ❌ Bad
   {"name": "helper", "description": "helps with stuff"}
   ```

2. **Instruct main agent to delegate:**

   ```python  theme={null}
   agent = create_deep_agent(
       system_prompt="""...your instructions...

       IMPORTANT: For complex tasks, delegate to your subagents using the task() tool.
       This keeps your context clean and improves results.""",
       subagents=[...]
   )
   ```
