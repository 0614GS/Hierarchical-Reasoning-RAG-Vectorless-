Deep agents is built on top of:

* [LangGraph](/oss/python/langgraph/overview) - Provides the underlying graph execution and state management
* [LangChain](/oss/python/langchain/overview) - Tools and model integrations work seamlessly with deep agents
* [LangSmith](/langsmith/home) - Observability, evaluation, and deployment

Deep agents applications can be deployed via [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployments) and monitored with [LangSmith Observability](/langsmith/observability).
