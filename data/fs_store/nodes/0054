An agent can update its own instructions based on feedback:

```python  theme={null}
agent = create_deep_agent(
    store=InMemoryStore(),
    backend=lambda rt: CompositeBackend(
        default=StateBackend(rt),
        routes={"/memories/": StoreBackend(rt)}
    ),
    system_prompt="""You have a file at /memories/instructions.txt with additional
    instructions and preferences.

    Read this file at the start of conversations to understand user preferences.

    When users provide feedback like "please always do X" or "I prefer Y",
    update /memories/instructions.txt using the edit_file tool."""
)
```

Over time, the instructions file accumulates user preferences, helping the agent improve.
