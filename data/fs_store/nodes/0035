The `allowed_decisions` list controls what actions a human can take when reviewing a tool call:

* **`"approve"`**: Execute the tool with the original arguments as proposed by the agent
* **`"edit"`**: Modify the tool arguments before execution
* **`"reject"`**: Skip executing this tool call entirely

You can customize which decisions are available for each tool:

```python  theme={null}
interrupt_on = {
    # Sensitive operations: allow all options
    "delete_file": {"allowed_decisions": ["approve", "edit", "reject"]},

    # Moderate risk: approval or rejection only
    "write_file": {"allowed_decisions": ["approve", "reject"]},

    # Must approve (no rejection allowed)
    "critical_operation": {"allowed_decisions": ["approve"]},
}
```
