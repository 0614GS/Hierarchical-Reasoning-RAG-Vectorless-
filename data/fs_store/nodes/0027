The harness allows the main agent to create ephemeral "subagents" for isolated multi-step tasks.

**Why it's useful:**

* **Context isolation** - Subagent's work doesn't clutter main agent's context
* **Parallel execution** - Multiple subagents can run concurrently
* **Specialization** - Subagents can have different tools/configurations
* **Token efficiency** - Large subtask context is compressed into a single result

**How it works:**

* Main agent has a `task` tool
* When invoked, creates a fresh agent instance with its own context
* Subagent executes autonomously until completion
* Returns a single final report to the main agent
* Subagents are stateless (can't send multiple messages back)

**Default subagent:**

* "general-purpose" subagent automatically available
* Has filesystem tools by default
* Can be customized with additional tools/middleware

**Custom subagents:**

* Define specialized subagents with specific tools
* Example: code-reviewer, web-researcher, test-runner
* Configure via `subagents` parameter
