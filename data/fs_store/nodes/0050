The `CompositeBackend` routes file operations based on path prefixes:

* Files with paths starting with `/memories/` are stored in the Store (persistent)
* Files without this prefix remain in transient state
* All filesystem tools (`ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`) work with both

```python  theme={null}
# Transient file (lost after thread ends)
agent.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write draft to /draft.txt"}]
})

# Persistent file (survives across threads)
agent.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Save final report to /memories/report.txt"}]
})
```
