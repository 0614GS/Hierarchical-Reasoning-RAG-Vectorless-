The harness automatically dumps large tool results to the file system when they exceed a token threshold, preventing context window saturation.

**How it works:**

* Monitors tool call results for size (default threshold: 20,000 tokens)
* When exceeded, writes the result to a file instead
* Replaces the tool result with a concise reference to the file
* Agent can later read the file if needed
