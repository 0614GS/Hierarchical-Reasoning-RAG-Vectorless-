Build up knowledge over multiple conversations:

```python  theme={null}
# Conversation 1: Learn about a project
agent.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "We're building a web app with React. Save project notes."}]
})

# Conversation 2: Use that knowledge
agent.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What framework are we using?"}]
})
# Agent reads /memories/project_notes.txt from previous conversation
```
