> Interactive command-line interface for building with Deep Agents

A terminal interface for building agents with persistent memory. Agents maintain context across sessions, learn project conventions, and execute code with approval controls.

The Deep Agents CLI has the following built-in capabilities:

* <Icon icon="file" size={16} /> **File operations** - read, write, and edit files in your project with tools that enable agents to manage and modify code and documentation.
* <Icon icon="terminal" size={16} /> **Shell command execution** - execute shell commands to run tests, build projects, manage dependencies, and interact with version control systems.
* <Icon icon="magnifying-glass" size={16} /> **Web search** - search the web for up-to-date information and documentation (requires Tavily API key).
* <Icon icon="globe" size={16} /> **HTTP requests** - make HTTP requests to APIs and external services for data fetching and integration tasks.
* <Icon icon="list-check" size={16} /> **Task planning and tracking** - break down complex tasks into discrete steps and track progress through the built-in todo system.
* <Icon icon="brain" size={16} /> **Memory storage and retrieval** - store and retrieve information across sessions, enabling agents to remember project conventions and learned patterns.
* <Icon icon="head-side" size={16} /> **Human-in-the-loop** - require human approval for sensitive tool operations.
