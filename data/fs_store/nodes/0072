<Card title="Planning and task decomposition" icon="timeline">
  Deep agents include a built-in `write_todos` tool that enables agents to break down complex tasks into discrete steps, track progress, and adapt plans as new information emerges.
</Card>

<Card title="Context management" icon="scissors">
  File system tools (`ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`) allow agents to offload large context to memory, preventing context window overflow and enabling work with variable-length tool results.
</Card>

<Card title="Subagent spawning" icon="people-group">
  A built-in `task` tool enables agents to spawn specialized subagents for context isolation. This keeps the main agent's context clean while still going deep on specific subtasks.
</Card>

<Card title="Long-term memory" icon="database">
  Extend agents with persistent memory across threads using LangGraph's Store. Agents can save and retrieve information from previous conversations.
