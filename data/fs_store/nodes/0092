The general-purpose subagent is ideal for context isolation without specialized behavior. The main agent can delegate a complex multi-step task to this subagent and get a concise result back without bloat from intermediate tool calls.

<Card title="Example">
  Instead of the main agent making 10 web searches and filling its context with results, it delegates to the general-purpose subagent: `task(name="general-purpose", task="Research quantum computing trends")`. The subagent performs all the searches internally and returns only a summary.
