Human-in-the-loop requires a checkpointer to persist agent state between the interrupt and resume:

```python  theme={null}
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

checkpointer = MemorySaver()
agent = create_deep_agent(
    tools=[...],
    interrupt_on={...},
    checkpointer=checkpointer  # Required for HITL
)
```
