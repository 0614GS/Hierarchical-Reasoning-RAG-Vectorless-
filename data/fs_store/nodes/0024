The harness provides six tools for file system operations, making files first-class citizens in the agent's environment:

| Tool         | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ls`         | List files in a directory with metadata (size, modified time)                                 |
| `read_file`  | Read file contents with line numbers, supports offset/limit for large files                   |
| `write_file` | Create new files                                                                              |
| `edit_file`  | Perform exact string replacements in files (with global replace mode)                         |
| `glob`       | Find files matching patterns (e.g., `**/*.py`)                                                |
| `grep`       | Search file contents with multiple output modes (files only, content with context, or counts) |
