Execute code in isolated remote environments for safety and flexibility. Remote sandboxes provide the following benefits:

* **Safety**: Protect your local machine from potentially harmful code execution
* **Clean environments**: Use specific dependencies or OS configurations without local setup
* **Parallel execution**: Run multiple agents simultaneously in isolated environments
* **Long-running tasks**: Execute time-intensive operations without blocking your machine
* **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent execution environments across teams

To use a remote sandbox, follow these steps:

1. Configure your sandbox provider ([Runloop](https://www.runloop.ai/), [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io/), or [Modal](https://modal.com/)):

   ```bash  theme={null}
   # Runloop
   export RUNLOOP_API_KEY="your-key"

   # Daytona
   export DAYTONA_API_KEY="your-key"

   # Modal
   modal setup
   ```

2. Run the CLI with a sandbox:

   ```bash  theme={null}
   uvx deepagents-cli --sandbox runloop --sandbox-setup ./setup.sh
   ```

   The agent runs locally but executes all code operations in the remote sandbox. Optional setup scripts can configure environment variables, clone repositories, and prepare dependencies.

3. (Optional) Create a `setup.sh` file to configure your sandbox environment:

   ```bash  theme={null}
   #!/bin/bash
   set -e

   # Clone repository using GitHub token
   git clone https://x-access-token:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/username/repo.git $HOME/workspace
   cd $HOME/workspace

   # Make environment variables persistent
   cat >> ~/.bashrc <<'EOF'
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
   cd $HOME/workspace
   EOF

   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   Store secrets in a local `.env` file for the setup script to access.

<Warning>
  Sandboxes isolate code execution, but agents remain vulnerable to prompt injection with untrusted inputs. Use human-in-the-loop approval, short-lived secrets, and trusted setup scripts only.

  Note that sandbox APIs are evolving rapidly, and we expect more providers to support proxies that help mitigate prompt injection and secrets management concerns.
</Warning>
