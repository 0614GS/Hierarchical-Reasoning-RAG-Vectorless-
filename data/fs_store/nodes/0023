We think of `deepagents` as an ["agent harness"](https://blog.langchain.com/agent-frameworks-runtimes-and-harnesses-oh-my/). It is the same core tool calling loop as other agent frameworks, but with built-in tools and capabilities.

    Agent[Deep Agent] --> Tools[File System Tools]
    Agent --> Todo[To-Do List]
    Agent --> Sub[Subagents]

    Tools --> Backend[Storage Backend]
    Backend --> State[State]
    Backend --> Disk[Filesystem]
    Backend --> Store[Store]

    Sub --> |isolated work| Result[Final Result]
    Result --> Agent
```

This page lists out the components that make up the agent harness.
