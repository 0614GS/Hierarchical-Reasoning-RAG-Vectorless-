Only give subagents the tools they need. This improves focus and security:

```python  theme={null}
# ✅ Good: Focused tool set
email_agent = {
    "name": "email-sender",
    "tools": [send_email, validate_email],  # Only email-related
}

# ❌ Bad: Too many tools
email_agent = {
    "name": "email-sender",
    "tools": [send_email, web_search, database_query, file_upload],  # Unfocused
}
```
