Deep agents come with a built-in system prompt inspired by Claude Code's system prompt. The default system prompt contains detailed instructions for using the built-in planning tool, file system tools, and subagents.

Each deep agent tailored to a use case should include a custom system prompt specific to that use case.

```python  theme={null}
from deepagents import create_deep_agent

research_instructions = """\
You are an expert researcher. Your job is to conduct \
thorough research, and then write a polished report. \
"""

agent = create_deep_agent(
    system_prompt=research_instructions,
)
```
