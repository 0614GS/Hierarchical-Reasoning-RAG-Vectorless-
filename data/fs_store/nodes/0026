The harness abstracts file system operations behind a protocol, allowing different storage strategies for different use cases.

**Available backends:**

1. **StateBackend** - Ephemeral in-memory storage
   * Files live in the agent's state (checkpointed with conversation)
   * Persists within a thread but not across threads
   * Useful for temporary working files

2. **FilesystemBackend** - Real filesystem access
   * Read/write from actual disk
   * Supports virtual mode (sandboxed to a root directory)
   * Integrates with system tools (ripgrep for grep)
   * Security features: path validation, size limits, symlink prevention

3. **StoreBackend** - Persistent cross-conversation storage
   * Uses LangGraph's BaseStore for durability
   * Namespaced per assistant\_id
   * Files persist across conversations
   * Useful for long-term memory or knowledge bases

4. **CompositeBackend** - Route different paths to different backends
   * Example: `/` → StateBackend, `/memories/` → StoreBackend
   * Longest-prefix matching for routing
   * Enables hybrid storage strategies
