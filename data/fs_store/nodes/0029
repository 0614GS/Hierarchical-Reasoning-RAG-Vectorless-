The harness fixes message history when tool calls are interrupted or cancelled before receiving results.

**The problem:**

* Agent requests tool call: "Please run X"
* Tool call is interrupted (user cancels, error, etc.)
* Agent sees tool\_call in AIMessage but no corresponding ToolMessage
* This creates an invalid message sequence

**The solution:**

* Detects AIMessages with tool\_calls that have no results
* Creates synthetic ToolMessage responses indicating the call was cancelled
* Repairs the message history before agent execution

**Why it's useful:**

* Prevents agent confusion from incomplete message chains
* Gracefully handles interruptions and errors
* Maintains conversation coherence
