Agents store information in `~/.deepagents/AGENT_NAME/memories/` as markdown files using a memory-first protocol:

1. **Research**: Searches memory for relevant context before starting tasks
2. **Response**: Checks memory when uncertain during execution
3. **Learning**: Automatically saves new information for future sessions

Organize memories by topic with descriptive filenames:

```
~/.deepagents/backend-dev/memories/
├── api-conventions.md
├── database-schema.md
└── deployment-process.md
```

Teach the agent conventions once:

```bash  theme={null}
uvx deepagents-cli --agent backend-dev
> Our API uses snake_case and includes created_at/updated_at timestamps
```

It remembers for future sessions:

```bash  theme={null}
> Create a /users endpoint
# Applies conventions without prompting
```
